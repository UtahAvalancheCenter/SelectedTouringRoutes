UAC Selected Touring Routes (BETA)

Written using Mapbox GL JS

The html code creates a map describing selected touring routes from the Utah Avalanche Center. The map is designed to assist backcountry users on terrain management skills and IS NOT an indication of avalanche hazard. Know before you go. Get the gear, get the training, get the forecast, get the picture, and get out of harms way.
